# Brain
A fun little project of making a digital brain

Originally was just gonna be a small little project, an idea I had while working on my Ants project and a nice distraction.

Ended up spending an obsene amount of time on it testing and iterating. Some tears were shed, but can confidently say that my work on the ant project vastly prepared me for this one, which was good because another project spawned off this one as a result anyways. Wooo.

Only now got around to actually making it a repository, because it was feeling more and more like an actual project rather then a side quest. But yeah, we are here now, so progress can be adequetly tracked.

Goals:
- Thinking brain that runs decently stablly
- Useable hookup to various inputs (ie camera vs microphone or swap to a pressure sensor) and outputs (ie motor, actuator, button, video game, numatic pump)
- Efficent and able to run massive amounts of neurons realitivly cheaply (stuck at 200 rn with an update of roughly 60 fps)
- Generally clean up and finish the whole thing, its really inefficient right now, and I don't even have the outputs done yet
